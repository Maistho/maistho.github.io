Since angular doesn't work without some fixes, using Ionic in Windows Phone is not at all as straightforward as it should be.
In order to make it work, these are the steps you need to follow:

1. Include winstore-jscompat
2. Use the github version of https://github.com/msopentech/cordova-plugin-websql/ instead of the npm version.
3. Don't use imgcache, something about it just breaks.
4. Map stuff seems to break
5. Icons seem to break
6. don't use any a links. Use div with ui-sref instead.
